# hello-world

So my name is Ericka, I live in Miami, Fl
I'm a full time college student majoring in software engineering/ computer science.
I inspire to build applications as a passion project, but I would love to work for start up companies puting my passion and skills to use.

So far on this journey of tech ive developed 3 focused passions.
